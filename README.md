`tame-oauth` is a small oauth crate that follows the [sans-io](https://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) approach.

## Why?

* You want to control how you actually make oauth HTTP requests

## Why not?

* The only auth flow that is currently implemented is the service account flow for GCP. Other flows
can be added, but right now that is the only one we need.
* There are several other oauth crates available that have many more features and are easier
to work with, if you don't care about what HTTP clients they use.
* This crate requires more boilerplate to use.

## Examples

### [svc_account](examples/svc_account.rs)

Usage: `cargo run --example svc_account -- <key_path> <scope..>`

A small example of using `tame-oauth` together with [reqwest](). Given a key file and 1 or more scopes,
it will attempt to get a token that could be used to access resources in those scopes.

`cargo run --example svc_account -- ~/.secrets/super-sekret.json https://www.googleapis.com/auth/pubsub https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only`
